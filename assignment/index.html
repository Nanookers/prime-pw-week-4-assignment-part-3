      <ul>
       <li> It might be nice to spend some time on the stretch goals in class. I feel like I overcomplicated it, and then confused myself</li>
       <li> Working with if/else felt challenging in function, particularly when combining cart is full and addItem.</li>
       <li> listItems was also surprisibly difficult to work. I could get it to work outside of a function, but not so well inside of the function.</li>
      </ul>
